- The script uses OnTriggerEnter to detect collisions with GameObjects.
- Attach the script to your Character Controller or GameManager or any other GameObject in the scene.
- Put your lazer / obstacle into the 'Obstacle' space.
- Put your switch / trigger into the 'Trigger' space.
- Set the cooldown / turn-off timer in seconds in the 'Timer' space.
- Now test the game and it should hopefully run properly.

- Read the comments in the script to get the explanations.
